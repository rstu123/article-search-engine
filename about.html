            <p>Article search engines have unique data requirements. They need to maintain a vast amount
                of information from various sources, manage metadata, and ensure quick and efficient
                retrieval of articles based on user queries. You can solve the data-related problems of an
                article search engine by creating a DBMS solution.
                First, you should assign unique IDs to the articles and store the relevant information under the
                same. You'll have to add the article's title, author, publication date, source, and the content of
                the article. You'll also have to mention the category or the topic of the article (such as
                technology, health, business, etc.).
                After that, you should add information about the sources. A source can publish multiple
                articles, and it would have a unique ID as well. Sources would also be classified into different
                categories.
                Users would search for articles, so you'll need to add that information to your database too.
                Apart from that, there would be distinct search parameters (keywords, date range, source,
                etc.) in the search engine. Then, you'd have to add the information of search history and user
                preferences.
                You can start with a small set of articles and expand it as you move on. Make sure that the
                data is easily understandable and accessible. The database should be designed in a way that it
                can handle a large number of queries and return accurate results quickly. It should also be
                scalable to accommodate the growth of articles and users over time.</p>
